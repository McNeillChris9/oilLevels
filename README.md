oilLevels
=========

Raspberry Pi project to monitor oil tank levels and consumption

Background
===========

This is my first Raspberry Pi project, and in an attempt to learn what it can do I thought I'd start with something I could gain value from. After recently moving into a house which has Oil heating I thought it would be good to build some sort of monitor for the oil tank so I know when it needs re-filled etc. (a bit like a watchMan http://www.sensor-systems.com/products/watchmansonic.aspx) 

Functionality
=======

I hope to gradually improve the functionality provided by this as I learn new skills, and as I get time to add fancy features. but for not the initial plan is to do one thing
 * Check the amount of oil remaining
 
Over time I hope to add some more things such as:
  * Level of usage per day/month etc
  * Taking into consideration external temperatures for more accurate readings of oil levels
  * Graphical Interface (web-based) to give visual feedback (graphs/charts etc)
